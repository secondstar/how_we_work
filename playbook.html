        <h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>
        <p>You work at thoughtbot. This is your playbook. It details how
 you and your teammates run our software consulting company and how we 
make web and mobile products together. It is a living document that you 
can edit in a private GitHub repo.</p>
        <p>It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.</p>
        <p>We've made the playbook free and licensed it as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial</a>
 so others may learn from, or use, our tactics in their own companies. 
While our "plays" have worked for us, we trust their judgment over ours 
to decide which tools and techniques might work for them, too.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/creative-commons.png" alt="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial"><figcaption>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some of our work needs to be private, such as links to 
various accounts like our HR system or documentation on how we handle 
credentials. Look in our private company handbook repository for that 
kind of information.</p>
        <p>Some of our work is very technical, but can be public, such as our git protocol for feature branches. Look in our <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides">public <code>thoughtbot/guides</code> GitHub repo</a> for that kind of information.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h1 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h1>
        <p>We regularly eliminate and simplify policies. Our most important policy is "use your best judgement".</p>
        <p>We strive for few job titles, few departments, and few 
hierarchies. We prefer composition of roles necessary for projects and 
company objectives over inheritance of bosses and direct reports. We are
 at thoughtbot primarily for our design and development skill, and want 
to apply it, rather than creating company overhead.</p>
        <p>We avoid having private conversations about each other or 
clients. Instead, we talk in person, and use tools such as Slack, 
Basecamp, and GitHub to communicate openly within a project, within 
thoughtbot, and publicly.</p>
        <p>While we should be cognizant of people's feelings, and seek 
to work with each other constructively, we cannot let those concerns get
 in the way of our happiness and the success of our work. We'd rather be
 too honest than too polite.</p>
        <p>Our standards are very high, and bringing on a new team member requires a "yes" from everyone who participated in the <a href="#interviewing">interview process</a>.
 Therefore, we expect the best from each other, give each other the 
benefit of the doubt, and encourage each other to take initiative to 
improve ourselves and the company.</p>
        <p>We recognize that we can always be better. Therefore, we have
 strong opinions, loosely held, and take initiative to improve 
ourselves, the company, and our community.</p>
        <h1 id="time">Time</h1>
        <p>We work a <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/overtime.html">sustainable pace</a>.
 We work four days for clients on consulting and one day on "investment 
time." We typically spend Monday-Thursday on client work and Friday on 
investment.</p>
        <p>When taking time off during client work, we discuss how it will impact the schedule with other team members.</p>
        <p>Sending off-hours communication may create an unintended 
sense of urgency with the recipients of your message. Try to avoid 
creating that urgency when possible.</p>
        <p>Unless actually urgent, you may ignore off-hours messages which you receive and handle them once you are back at work.</p>
        <h2 id="consulting">Consulting</h2>
        <p>We make our money on consulting projects. Those projects start with <a href="#sales">sales</a>
 and go through a normal flow of designing, developing, shipping, 
monitoring, and iterating. We should do such a good job for our clients 
that they will want to poach us, and be such a great place to work that 
we can be confident our teammates won't leave.</p>
        <h2 id="investment">Investment</h2>
        <p>Investment time is time for investment in ourselves, our 
company, and our community. Primarily this means doing something that 
interests us like learning a new programming language, contributing to 
open source, discussing interesting things, attending community events, 
or reading an educational book. The goal is to encourage individuals to 
improve and share their knowledge with the rest of the team.</p>
        <p>We organize our investment work on the "Investment Time" Trello board.</p>
        <p>Ideas for Fridays and in between client projects:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Contribute to <a href="#open-source">open source software</a>.</li>
        <li>Write a blog post. Manage it on the "Editorial Calendar" Trello board.</li>
        <li>Pick from or contribute back to <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.</li>
        <li>Explore change to tools and process on the "Research" Trello board</li>
        <li>Work on conference and meetup talks and proposals.</li>
        <li>Volunteer as a mentor for <a href="http://upcase.com/">Upcase</a>, <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis</a>, <a href="http://www.galvanize.com/courses/">Galvanize</a>, <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>, or <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>, or another solid learning organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some ideas that are more directly revenue generating:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Assist with <a href="#sales">sales</a>.</li>
        <li>Meet someone new or make an existing relationship stronger.</li>
        <li>Contribute to one of our existing <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/books">books</a> or create a new one.</li>
        <li>Create content for <a href="http://upcase.com/">Upcase</a>. Manage it on the "Upcase Content" Trello board. Pull from any list or add ideas to the "Ideas" list.</li>
        <li>Answer questions on the <a href="http://forum.upcase.com/">Upcase Forum</a>.</li>
        <li>Work on <a href="http://houndci.com/">Hound</a>.</li>
        <li>Help with <a href="http://formkeep.com/">FormKeep</a></li>
        <li>Assist with an unreleased product.</li>
        <li>Form a team, run a <a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#product-design-sprint">product design sprint</a>, and build on an idea of your own.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a difference between normal Friday investment time, and extended downtime between client projects.</p>
        <p>Extended periods of time between client projects should skew 
heavily towards revenue generating activities. This could be networking 
and sales, working on existing revenue generating products and services,
 or creating something new that will generate revenue.</p>
        <p>Because this extended time period will go away when you 
resume client work, and because we can't sustain non-revenue generating 
activities for long, approach this extended time between client projects
 with a sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>Validating ideas, shipping, and getting to revenue generation
 as quickly as possible should be a priority. We shouldn't go weeks 
without results to show, and we should impose the same constraints and 
process as we do on client projects.</p>
        <h1 id="product-design-sprint">Product Design Sprint</h1>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it 
looks like. People think it's this veneer â€” that the designers are 
handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think 
design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is 
how it works." - Steve Jobs</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint">Product Design Sprints</a>, an invention of <a href="http://www.gv.com/design/">Google Ventures' design team</a>, are 5-phase exercises intended to improve the chances of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/good.html">making something people want</a>.
 We want to turn false confidence into validated confidence before 
beginning an expensive build. Or, we want to dodge bullets by learning 
we shouldn't begin the expensive build at all.</p>
        <p>Sprints are useful starting points when kicking off a new 
product or workflow, as well as solving problems with an existing 
product. They typically last 5 days but we have done them in less time. 
We get as many stakeholders and expertises in the room as we can.</p>
        <p>Product design sprints are test-driven design.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/sprint-phases.png" alt="Sprint Phases"><figcaption>Sprint Phases</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2 id="prep-work">Prep Work</h2>
        <p>Before the sprint, our clients schedule 5 real humans for the
 tests we'll do in the last phase. They know their users better than we 
do.</p>
        <p>They also gather research from sources such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://quora.com/">Quora</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home">Adwords Keyword Planner</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also do some (paid) prep-work:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Schedule and run <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/interviewing-users/">user interviews</a>.</li>
        <li>Deploy a short <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/use_cases">survey</a> whose results we can review in the first phase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We typically order breakfast for the first day to make it 
feel special but don't order lunch for each day of the sprint. For both 
the sprints and normal days, we believe it's important to not have 
"working lunches", instead breaking from work for a short time to rest 
the brain, maybe get some fresh air, and interact with teammates and 
clients.</p>
        <h2 id="understand">Understand</h2>
        <p>The exercises in this phase help us understand and empathize 
with the users' life (consumer software) or work (business software) 
needs.</p>
        <p>Throughout the phase, people take notes, often on sticky notes that they stick to the walls of the room.</p>
        <p>We start with "pitch practice", where the client pitches 
their product like they would to investors. This helps us identify the 
user, their problem, and the job they are hiring the product to do. It 
also begins documenting the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">vocabulary used in the domain</a>.</p>
        <p>We then review research from Quora, Analytics, AdWords 
Keyword Planner, interviews, and surveys. This helps us understand 
users' motivation, the marketing funnel, and the size of target markets.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we sketch what the rest of the sprint will focus on: 
the critical path for the software. At this point, we try to keep this 
high-level and as light on implementation details as possible. A great 
question to help generate the critical path is:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y">What job is the user hiring the product to do?</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/criticalpath.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/criticalpath_small.jpg" alt="Critical Path"><div style="width: 640px; height: 207px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Critical Path</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We will edit the critical path as we move through the phases.</p>
        <h2 id="diverge">Diverge</h2>
        <p>The exercises in this phase help us exhaust our imaginations for potential solutions that meet the users' needs.</p>
        <p>Before this phase, the team naturally walks around the room 
reviewing the walls, covered in the critical path and lots of sticky 
notes.</p>
        <p>We start with "pitch practice" again, comparing to the critical path.</p>
        <p>We then have each person individually sketch 10+ <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows">user flows</a>
 and user interfaces. We ask people to include the sources where the 
customer will come from: Twitter? A blog post? AdWords? Automated 
suggestions? Drip email? Referral from a friend? Push notification?</p>
        <p>Should the product become realized, these sources should eventually be measured in <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2013/10/new-acquisitions-reporting-channels.html">Google Analytics' "Acquisition Channels" report</a>:</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/acquisition-channels.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/acquisition-channels_small.jpg" alt="Acquisition Channels"><div style="width: 640px; height: 236px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Acquisition Channels</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We then put those sketches on the wall and begin a silent critique, observing and putting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M3SBM2">dot stickers</a> on different parts of the flows and user interfaces that we like. This helps visually identify the best ideas.</p>
        <p>We then do a group critique, three minutes per idea. The 
group explains their dots. The author can then add any extra commentary.
 We don't shoot down any ideas or start winnowing. This voting process 
helps avoid long discussions and design-by-committee.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we do a "super vote" with larger, red dot stickers. 
The CEO or other product owner will place a single "super vote" on what 
they think is the best idea. This helps us reflect the reality of how 
their organization makes decisions and affirm their ultimate authority.</p>
        <p>Our experience has been that this phase is mentally 
exhausting. We recommend ending early and sending people home to 
re-charge their batteries.</p>
        <h2 id="converge">Converge</h2>
        <p>The exercises in this phase force us to stop generating new 
solutions, converge on the best, and write the test for the prototype.</p>
        <p>First, we identify assumptions we're making in the best 
ideas. We list all assumptions about users' motivations, the business 
model, our ability to acquire users, and our ability to implement the 
solution within budget. This helps eliminate some options.</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/assumptions.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/assumptions_small.jpg" alt="Assumptions"><div style="width: 640px; height: 336px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Assumptions</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We then look for conflicts in the remaining sticky notes, 
user flows, and user interfaces: ideas that aim to solve the same 
problem in different ways. We eliminate solutions that can't be pursued 
currently.</p>
        <p>We then decide whether we're creating one prototype ("best 
shot") or multiple ("battle royale"). Multiple prototypes are more 
initial work but may reveal more dead ends and help us dodge more 
bullets without running follow-on sprints.</p>
        <p>We then storyboard each prototype. This is a comic book-style story of our customer moving through the critical path.</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/storyboard.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/storyboard_small.jpg" alt="Storyboard"><div style="width: 640px; height: 371px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Storyboard</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Lastly, we create the testing script in Google Docs and put 
the scoreboard on the wall of the observation room. The script is based 
on the storyboard and the scoreboard will be used to record the results 
of the test. This helps us be very explicit about what we're trying to 
learn.</p>
        <h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
        <p>After another pitch practice to rally the troops, there are 
no exercises in this phase. It is entirely focused on building the right
 prototype(s) with just the right amount of fidelity to generate useful 
test results.</p>
        <p>For the entire phase, we ask our clients to write copy text in Google Docs. They write <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch11_Use_Real_Words.php">real text, not lorem ipsum</a>,
 in order to test user understanding and enthusiasm. This text is also 
useful later for tweets, press, ad copy, landing pages, etc.</p>
        <p>While our clients are busy getting communication polished, we
 are heads-down prototyping. We use different tools depending on the 
designer and the project.</p>
        <p>For web app prototypes, some good options are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> templates</li>
        <li><a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> + <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a> + <a href="http://bitters.bourbon.io/">Bitters</a> locally</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For mobile app prototypes, some good options are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.flinto.com/">Flinto</a> + <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch/id402476602?mt=12">Sketch</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://popapp.in/">Prototyping on Paper</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't try to learn these tools during the sprint. Get 
familiar with them during investment time. During the sprint, use one 
that you've mastered.</p>
        <h2 id="test-and-learn">Test and Learn</h2>
        <p>Finally, we interview 5 users to test our understanding of 
them, their context, and our prototype. This is not a usability test. We
 begin the conversation as an interview before showing them the 
prototype.</p>
        <p>One of our designers interviews each user. We set them up in 
an interview room with video and audio streaming to the observation, 
where the rest of the stakeholders are watching, discussing, and 
recording answers on the scoreboard.</p>
        <p>Good questions are open-ended to allow users to tell stories.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Could you tell us about a time you donated to a non-profit?"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Don't lead users to an expected answer.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Would you donate money to a public school if you could?"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Don't close the conversation.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Have you donated money to an organization within the last week?"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For a new product, it's unlikely that any team will nail it 
their first sprint. The most likely outcome is that we'll want to run a 
follow-on sprint starting at Diverge or Converge and test again with a 
new users.</p>
        <p>After one or two sprints, we typically have many assumptions 
validated, a clear critical path established, and are ready to begin 
coding a first version to release to a wider audience.</p>
        <p>For web apps, we can typically ship a first version in 4-6 weeks. For mobile apps, we can typically ship a beta via <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/">HockeyApp</a> in 6-8 weeks and ship to the App Store in 8-10 weeks.</p>
        <p>Given those timelines, spending an extra 2-5 days doing a 
second or even third truncated product design sprint is worth the 
opportunity cost of spending 4x-10x more time and money to learn we 
bombed.</p>
        <p>Another outcome is that there's no clear user pain, or the 
business model is murky, or everything we thought we knew was proven 
wrong. That's an emotional blow, but a success. Time and money were 
saved.</p>
        <p>We end the phase with a plan for moving forward.</p>
        <h1 id="choose-platforms">Choose Platforms</h1>
        <p>Early in a project, we have to decide which platforms we'll use.</p>
        <p>Which platform depends on our ideas for solving these users' 
problems. For example, if they're construction workers on a job site, a 
mobile or tablet interface might be the best choice.</p>
        <p>After considering what's best for users, what's best for us?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The tools are open source with a strong community</li>
        <li>The tools make us happy</li>
        <li>The tools help us create and iterate quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="web-apps">Web Apps</h2>
        <p>In our experience, teams using the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
 framework can bring products to market more quickly and with a lower 
total cost of ownership than other tools, because the framework itself 
and surrounding community embrace a "convention over configuration" 
mindset. This means that one Rails app's codebase will look very similar
 to another Rails app's codebase, and the team will find themselves in 
familiar technical territory, freeing them up to focus on the product 
instead of wrestling with the code. There's also strong overlap between 
the agile and Ruby communities, which means (among things) that Ruby 
developers tend to write tests, use object-oriented design, and avoid 
repeated code.</p>
        <p>Maybe the greatest compliment we can pay to Rails is that 
we've made an existential financial commitment to it, betting the future
 of the company on it in 2005, and we're still here.</p>
        <p>In return, we're proud of our contributions to the community, in particular our <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot">open source libraries</a> and articles on our blog, <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/">GIANT ROBOTS SMASHING INTO OTHER GIANT ROBOTS</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to Ruby, we use other open source software and 
web standards such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UNIX, Vim, and Postgres 
because they:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Are high quality.</li>
        <li>Avoid vendor lock-in.</li>
        <li>Provide flexibility to switch components.</li>
        <li>Work on many devices.</li>
        <li>Are battle-tested.</li>
        <li>Have few bugs when seen by many eyes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ruby on Rails comes with features that decrease the burden on the programmer to protect against security attacks such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
        <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
        <li>SQL injection</li>
        <li>Header injection</li>
        <li>Sensitive data in logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rails helps us do the right thing with regards to security 
but we are still required to be diligent, knowledgeable, and test 
comprehensively. For more information, see the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">Ruby on Rails Security Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>We support Internet Explorer 10.0+ and the latest versions of
 Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. We do not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, 
8, or 9. Those browsers are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Market_adoption_and_usage_share">losing market share</a>, they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Security_issues">security issues</a>, and they are time-consuming to design for, develop for, and support.</p>
        <p>On mobile devices, we support iOS Safari 7.1+, Android Browser 4.4+, and the latest version of Chrome for Android.</p>
        <p>In limited special cases, user demographics will dictate that
 supporting an older version of Internet Explorer is required. Those 
special cases should be identified early on so we can plan for 
additional time and expense in order to support the version.</p>
        <h2 id="mobile-apps">Mobile Apps</h2>
        <p>"Mobile" refers to the user, not the device.</p>
        <p>Everything about how we design a mobile application has to be in the context of that idea. It raises questions like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Are they moving?</li>
        <li>Are they relaxed on a couch?</li>
        <li>How dexterous are their fingers?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We try to start with the most usable platform first. If the 
device needs the camera, calendar, or address book, a "native" app like 
an iPhone or iPad app may be the right choice.</p>
        <p>For other products, especially content-only products such as 
text, images, videos, and landing pages, a mobile web app makes sense 
because:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>All modern smart phones can render HTML.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon">Bourbon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat">Neat</a> make "responsive" designs easy to implement.</li>
        <li>We can create and iterate quickly.</li>
        <li>We can deploy new versions multiple times a day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our mobile developers' expertise is with the Objective-C, and
 more recently Swift, programming languages and iOS frameworks such as 
Cocoa.</p>
        <p>We don't take on Titanium or PhoneGap projects because of:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Cost: it is a costly burden on our designers to try to 
design for the iOS and Android platforms at the same time. The 
differences in screen sizes, resolutions, aspect ratios, and expected 
user interface patterns require different design solutions.</li>
        <li>Early access to upgrades: Apple's NDA forces 3rd party apps 
like Titanium to wait until new iOS versions are released to the public 
before they can code against them. Working the way Apple recommends, we 
get access to new versions months early. We can use new features earlier
 to make the app feel more modern. We can use the new ways of doing 
things to save lines of code and time.</li>
        <li>Quality: Appcelerator, like past cross-platform technologies
 such as Adobe Air or Adobe Flash, provide a least-common denominator 
user experience. They may or may not be compiled to "native" code but 
they rarely achieve a "native" feel.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>Examples of languages we typically use are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ruby: our server-side preference</li>
        <li>CoffeeScript: our client-side preference</li>
        <li>Swift: the language for iOS apps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Server-side" means code that is run on servers provided by 
the application hosting company. "Client-side" means code that is run in
 users' web browsers.</p>
        <h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and other libraries are frameworks 
that require developers know the underlying language such as Ruby or 
JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Examples of frameworks we typically use are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Angular.js</li>
        <li>Ember.js</li>
        <li>iOS Core Data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A framework is a library that makes performing a particular 
task in a programming language easier. Like the framework of a house, it
 is there when we begin programming and is always there giving the 
program structure and support.</p>
        <p>It can be difficult to switch from one framework to another. 
The more code that's written specifically for Rails, the harder it will 
be to switch to Django. That would approach "total rewrite" territory.</p>
        <h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
        <p>For data that must be saved and stored correctly, we use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (we usually refer to it as "Postgres").</p>
        <p>It's a 30 year old open source database that is highly 
respected, well supported by documentation and hosting providers, and 
used by any developer who knows the SQL standard.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a movement called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>
 has gained popularity. Best translated as "not only SQL", tremendous 
effort has been made to create different kinds of databases for 
different use cases, often based off <a href="http://nosqlsummer.org/papers">academic or industry research</a>.</p>
        <p>Our most frequently used NoSQL database is <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>,
 which we use for storing transient, high quantity read/write data such 
as activity feeds, tags, background jobs, sessions, tokens, and 
counters.</p>
        <p>Redis is reliable, open-source, and simple. It offers high 
performance and reliable predictions of its performance. It can flexibly
 model different data sets but we typically use it for small data 
structures, not large images, videos, or text documents.</p>
        <p>We typically use <a href="https://redistogo.com/">Redis to Go</a> to host our production Redis databases.</p>
        <h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
        <p>In contrast with a proprietary license, the source code of an
 open source program is made available for review, modification and 
redistribution. The difference between open source licenses is what we 
can and can't do with the source code.</p>
        <p>Open source licenses can be divided in two categories: permissive and copyleft.</p>
        <p>Permissive examples include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licenses</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache license</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A copyleft example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">General Public License (GPL)</a>.</p>
        <p>Both categories have the purpose of establishing the 
copyright holder for the software, granting users the right to copy, 
modify and redistribute it, protecting the copyright holder from any 
potential guarantees that the software may provide (software is provided
 as-is), and optionally imposing some restrictions.</p>
        <p>Permissive licenses let us modify a program, redistribute it,
 and even sell it. We can embed or link code with other programs without
 restriction or explicit permission by the copyright holder.</p>
        <p>Copyleft licenses only allow us to link or distribute code 
with other code that has the same license. It also forces modifications 
to be released under the same license. Combining anything with the GPL 
makes it GPL.</p>
        <p>Non-copyleft licenses do not enforce derivative works to also be open source.</p>
        <p>Some software is released under a dual license: both a 
permissive and copyleft license. This provides developers who use the 
dual licensed code to apply the license that better suits their needs.</p>
        <p>Most of the software we use has a permissive license:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL License (BSD based)</li>
        <li>Redis, BSD</li>
        <li>Ruby (MRI), Ruby license (BSD based)</li>
        <li>Ruby on Rails, MIT</li>
        <li>jQuery, Dual MIT and GPL</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="laptop-setup">Laptop Setup</h1>
        <p>Your laptop is your sword. Don't go into battle without it. Set up your laptop with <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">this script</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">these dotfiles</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="laptop">Laptop</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">Laptop</a> is a script to set up a Mac OS X or Linux laptop for Rails development. It should take less than 15 minutes to install.</p>
        <p>This sets up compilers, databases, programming languages, 
package management systems, installers, and other critical programs to 
our daily programming activities.</p>
        <h2 id="dotfiles">Dotfiles</h2>
        <p>'Dotfile' is a generalized term for a UNIX configuration file, typically prefixed with a dot (e.g. <code>.vimrc</code>) and found in your home directory. Most UNIX programs, including Vim, will load a dotfile during launch.</p>
        <p>We recommend using dotfiles to customize your tools and 
environment to suit your preferences, reduce typing, and get work done. 
Check them into a git repository for safe-keeping and open-source for 
the benefit of others.</p>
        <p>Use our <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to make pair programming with teammates easier and make each other more productive.</p>
        <h2 id="text-editor">Text Editor</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work
 and simplifies debugging and testing. The editor should be an extension
 of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and 
programmable. -The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Almost everyone at thoughtbot uses <a href="https://upcase.com/vim">Vim</a> as our text editor.</p>
        <p>When we use Vim, we type few characters and avoid the mouse. We're productive and more easily achieve flow.</p>
        <p>It's great because:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Vim is tiny (1.6MB) and starts up instantly.</li>
        <li>Vim is a well-polished stone by virtue of how long it has 
been around. It was introduced in 1991 as an improvement on Vi, which 
itself was written in 1976 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a>.</li>
        <li>It has a rich ecosystem of open-source plugins.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="planning">Planning</h1>
        <p>One of our primary process goals is to make <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/releaseoften.html">frequent, small releases</a> of our working software.</p>
        <p>This section describes how we achieve one week's worth of 
iteration on a product. It lays out the process we follow and some 
communication tactics.</p>
        <h2 id="daily-standups">Daily Standups</h2>
        <p>Every morning, we get together as a team for 10 minutes at 10 AM.</p>
        <p>We say what we did yesterday, what we're going to do today, 
and if anything is blocking us. We immediately resolve blockers or help 
the person after standup.</p>
        <p>We do this in order to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>See each other face-to-face.</li>
        <li>Learn what others are doing so you can help them.</li>
        <li>Build accountability and trust.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
        <p>We have used JIRA, Pivotal Tracker, Lighthouse, Basecamp, 
Trajectory, Unfuddle, and other task management systems over the years. 
The following section details a process using Trello but the overall 
process remains relatively similar across different systems.</p>
        <p>No two products are the same, so flexibility in the product 
development process is important. Trello responds well to changing the 
structure of the process "on the fly."</p>
        <p>A Trello board is a software equivalent of a physical wall 
with columns of sticky notes. In Trello terminology, the wall is called a
 "board." The columns are called "lists." The sticky notes in columns 
are called "cards."</p>
        <p>In the following image, "Current" is an example of a board. 
"In Progress" is an example of a list. "Confirm Internet Explorer 
support" is an example of a card.</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/next-up-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/next-up-trello_small.jpg" alt="Next Up Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 346px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Next Up Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In any task management system, it's important to have a view 
into the product development process like this. The Next Up list is the 
single prioritized list to which the product team refers in order to 
know what to work on next. It represents one week of work.</p>
        <p>A card represents a jobs story, bug fix, engineering task, or general todo.</p>
        <p>Cards start out as a simple idea, 1-2 sentences long. As they
 are pulled through boards, detail is added, explaining why (from a 
business perspective) we're focusing on it, and maybe notes on suggested
 implementation (though designers and developers may take or leave it at
 their discretion; it's supposed to be helpful, not prescriptive).</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/live-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/live-trello_small.jpg" alt="Live Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 400px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Live Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Once the cards in the Next Up list have been prioritized and 
vetted, they are ready for design and development. A designer or 
developer "puts their face on it" by assigning it to themselves and 
pulling it into the In Progress list.</p>
        <p>The cards in the In Progress list are actively being designed
 or developed. Etiquette is that you should never have your face on more
 than two cards at a time. Work is done in a <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol">feature branch</a>.</p>
        <p>When a designer or developer creates a pull request for their
 feature branch, they move the card to the Code Review list. Any 
reviewers "put their face on it" while reviewing.</p>
        <p>There is no bottleneck for merging into master: everyone can do it.</p>
        <p>The cards in the Testing on Staging (or Testing on Ad Hoc 
build for iPhone apps) list are deployed to staging (or distributed via 
HockeyApp for iPhone apps). The card creator and a designer review it 
for accuracy and user experience.</p>
        <p>There is no bottleneck for deploying to staging: everyone can do it.</p>
        <p>The cards in the Ready for Production list include cards that
 have been accepted on staging and are ready to be deployed (but not 
necessarily rolled out).</p>
        <p>There is no bottleneck for releasing to production: everyone can do it.</p>
        <p>The cards in the Live (Week of [date]) lists have been 
released. Each week has its own Live list so we can follow what got 
released when.</p>
        <h2 id="weekly-meeting">Weekly Meeting</h2>
        <p>Once a week, usually on Monday, everyone meets in-person or 
via video conference. This replaces Monday's daily standup and is an 
opportunity for the entire team to discuss achievements, hurdles, and 
concerns with the goal of everyone leaving excited and empowered for the
 week of work to come.</p>
        <p>The advisor runs this meeting.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Understand how the team feels about last week's progress and
 what's to come. Ask each team member from both thoughtbot and the 
client, "How did you feel about last week? How do you feel coming into 
this week?" This is less a recap of the completed work (a better place 
being during <a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#daily-standups">daily standup</a>) and more a pulse of how each person feels. Take notes.</li>
        <li>Have each member of the team voice any risks or concerns; 
after everyone has had the opportunity to bring these up, work together 
as a group to mitigate these concerns. Encourage everyone to voice the 
same concerns even if they've already been mentioned; it helps 
prioritize what the team is most concerned about and should spend the 
most time fixing. This is an opportunity to discuss how to improve the 
process and product we're building together. Note who had which concerns
 and track how we'll be addressing these concerns.</li>
        <li>Celebrate success. Review the work that shipped last week, 
showing the actual product, and congratulate those who made it happen.</li>
        <li>After the retro is done, share the notes with the team and 
ensure anything actionable from the retro is captured. This allows 
teammates to view progress, understand how feelings on the project 
change over time, and accomplish anything we set out to do given the 
outcomes of the retro.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes from a retro may look something like this:</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>The stage of the product should guide the planning meeting. For example:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Research and Validation: Is a user interface flow validated enough to start making a minimal working version?</li>
        <li>Product Availability: Can users accomplish the flow with working, deployed software?</li>
        <li>User Engagement: What do numbers look like for that flow?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tell customer stories. Do people love this product? Show 
numbers. Are more people using the product this week than last? Are the 
same people using the product more this week than last?</p>
        <p>In all stages, we should be asking:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Are we building the right product?</li>
        <li>How much time remains based on the budget?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the answers to these questions, we record our plans in the task management system:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Archive the two-week old "Live (Week of [date])" list.</li>
        <li>Review product design priorities. Pull what we estimate to be an appropriate amount for this week into Next Up.</li>
        <li>Review bugs. Pull any important bugs into Next Up and 
prioritize them at the top of the queue before everything else. We want 
to always be fixing what's broken first.</li>
        <li>Review engineering and refactoring tasks. Pull cards into 
Next Up based on what the designers and developers believe is 
appropriate given the previously stated product design and bug tasks.</li>
        <li>Re-sort the entire Next Up queue according to priority. 
Cards that were at the top of the list last week may be moved to the 
bottom or back to other boards or lists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The task management system is the canonical repository for plans.</p>
        <p>When things are only said on the phone, in person, in emails 
that don't include the whole group, or in one-on-one chats, information 
gets lost, forgotten, or misinterpreted. The problems expand when 
someone joins or leaves the project.</p>
        <p>During this meeting, seek discussion with, not instruction 
from, clients. We can't talk about solutions until we identify the 
underlying problems.</p>
        <p>We've been called "aggressive" with our approach cutting 
features, budgets, and schedules. We say "no" a lot. It's hard to say 
"no." "No" is usually not well-received. There's a reason someone 
requested the feature.</p>
        <p>We have to battle sometimes in the face of "yes". We do so armed with knowledge of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/the-long-dismal-history-of-software-project-failure.html">the history of software success and failure</a>:
 in 2004, only 34% of software projects were considered successes. The 
good news is that was 100% better than the stats in 1994. "The primary 
reason is the projects have gotten a lot smaller."</p>
        <p>Few software projects fail because they aren't complicated 
enough. Saying "no" means keeping the software we're building as simple 
as possible. Every line of code we write is an asset and a liability.</p>
        <p>Simple software, once launched, is better suited to meeting 
the demands of customers. Complex software, if it ever even launches, is
 not as able to respond to customer demands quickly.</p>
        <h2 id="on-site-customer">On-site Customer</h2>
        <p>Tools like Slack, GitHub, and Trello have made remote work 
much easier over the years, and we work remotely every day within 
thoughtbot across offices.</p>
        <p>Remote consulting work is possible, but raises the degree of 
difficulty. One of the few requirements of Extreme Programming is that <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/customer.html">the customer is always available</a>.</p>
        <p>Ideally, that means face-to-face, on-site. We've set up our 
offices so that our clients work at the same cluster of desks as our 
teams. Nothing beats in-person communication.</p>
        <p>An ideal consulting project for us is one where a member of 
the client team is willing to work at our office Monday-Thursday for the
 duration of the project. Failing that, we want to find out during the 
sales process how available they will be on Slack, GitHub, and Trello.</p>
        <p>If it seems like they won't be available very often, we should seriously consider declining the project.</p>
        <h2 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h2>
        <p>Remote work is when the client and the team are in different 
locations, either the team is in another thoughtbot office from the 
client or team members work from a different location for the duration 
of the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Meet in person</strong></p>
        <p>At the beginning of a remote engagement, when possible, 
everyone should meet in person for at least one work week. This is 
useful in order to get to know the team members better and to develop 
relationships, which will make it easier to communicate through 
asynchronous channels in the future.</p>
        <p>If possible, it is beneficial to meet in person again throughout the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Well-defined roles and workflows</strong></p>
        <p>At the beginning of the project define who handles which 
role, and how to communicate amongst the team. For example, decide 
whether standups will be done via group chat messages or via voice or 
video call.</p>
        <p>If part of the team is remote, the whole team should work as 
if it were remote. We should over-communicate. Major decisions regarding
 the project must be documented online in a medium everyone is aware of 
and able to contribute to. This means that all project-related 
communication should be done in asynchronous channels that we already 
use, such as GitHub, Trello, Basecamp, and Slack. The only workflow 
difference using these tools when doing remote work is that we 
communicate all important information asynchronously, so that everyone 
stays informed.</p>
        <p>In person communication during a project usually includes 
frequent updates on current work and various social interactions. The 
chat room should be the space where we communicate, so that no one feels
 left out, especially team members who work remotely.</p>
        <p>Team members should also be conscious that asynchronous 
communication means that sometimes the other person is not immediately 
available to respond, and not expect them to. Furthermore, online 
communication lacks the non-verbal visual cues such as voice tone and 
inflection, facial expressions, and body language. We should be more 
careful in the language that we choose to use. A good reference is <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">our existing code review guide</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Feeling isolated</strong></p>
        <p>When working remotely, especially when alone, it is easy to 
forget how it feels to be immersed in team camaraderie. Video 
conferencing helps alleviate this feeling as well as occasional visits 
to the office, or working from a co-working space.</p>
        <p><strong>Work hours</strong></p>
        <p>We should try to have 4-6 hours (with consideration of time 
differences) in the work day that overlap between locations to allow for
 synchronous communication.</p>
        <p>For some people, it is sometimes difficult to disengage from 
work when working at home. Also, flexible hours means that sometime one 
may work non-traditional hours in the day. We should be conscious to 
keep to a sustainable pace and take a break away from work.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
        <p>Good tools for remote <a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#pair-programming">pair programming</a> are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://tmate.io/">tmate</a> and Vim or Emacs, 
since they require very little bandwidth and do not lag. Another channel
 will be needed for voice/video communication, such as a Hangout or 
Skype.</li>
        <li><a href="https://screenhero.com/">ScreenHero</a> when you need access to other software like the web browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="altering-the-process">Altering the Process</h2>
        <p>A single Trello board with a few lists as described above 
works well for most early-stage teams and products. As they grow, 
however, more organizational tools may be necessary. For example, we 
might want to first add lists to the "Current" board such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Bugs</li>
        <li>Product Design</li>
        <li>Engineering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Later on, <a href="http://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-product-management/">those lists might be better organized as entire boards themselves</a>.
 Separated as boards, it's easier to evaluate the relative value of 
addressing each related thing. Separate boards also keep the "Current" 
board clean and the product team focused on the week at hand.</p>
        <p>Each of those boards can be organized as the team sees fit for the stage of the product and the team's communication needs.</p>
        <p>On the "Bugs" board, we've sometimes used labels to describe 
relative criticality of the bug. If a bug is labeled Critical, then it 
is pulled immediately into Next Up on the "Current" board. If the bug is
 not critical, it stays in Bugs until the next weekly retrospective. A 
bug has steps to reproduce the bug and optionally a screenshot or 
screencast.</p>
        <p>The cards on the "Product Design" board are typically the 
result of sketching user flows, usability tests, other user research, or
 the designer's feel for visual design improvements.</p>
        <p>The cards on the "Engineering" board are refactorings and 
other engineering tasks necessary to reduce bugs or improve the user 
experience. "Response time" is a primary user experience goal on every 
app. If an engineering task is labeled Critical, then it is pulled 
immediately to Next Up. If the task is not critical, it stays in 
Engineering until the next weekly retrospective.</p>
        <h1 id="designing">Designing</h1>
        <p>This may surprise you, but most of our designers use Vim as 
their primary text editor. This isn't the only characteristic that has 
become distinctly thoughtbot.</p>
        <p>Many of our projects are frequently undergoing rapid change. 
Without classic Photoshop comps or requirements documents, how do our 
designers fit into the process?</p>
        <h2 id="sketches">Sketches</h2>
        <p>Just like during the product design sprint, our designers are
 often sketching interfaces before implementing them. Also like the 
sprint, anyone on the team is encouraged to sketch at any time.</p>
        <p>We have many <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Squared-Notebook-Cover-Pocket/dp/8883707125">Moleskine squared, soft, pocket-sized notebooks</a>
 around the offices. Take one. The pocket size encourages the habit of 
getting ideas onto paper whenever and wherever they hit us. The pocket 
size also forces design constraints and mobile-first thinking.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/moleskines.jpg" alt="Moleskines"><figcaption>Moleskines</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h2>
        <p>The designer will then refine the sketches into HTML and CSS wireframes. HTML and CSS wireframes are built using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon">Bourbon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat">Neat</a>
 in the browser so the team can understand the core experience as fast 
as possible. It also allows developers to start implementing features 
within the wireframes.</p>
        <p>It is crucial to keep the design of the application ahead of 
the development. Focus should be placed on wireframing usability, user 
experience, and flows.</p>
        <p>We find it important to keep the design and development cycle
 adequately tight. We do not wireframe one month out because as we 
approach certain areas of the product, we often decide to cut or change 
features.</p>
        <p>Those changes are an expected part of the iterative process 
and feedback loop between the client, the thoughtbot team, and users. It
 would be wasteful to spend time wireframing features that never get 
built or building features that won't be used.</p>
        <h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>An interface is a place where two things meet: the human and 
the computer. The computer has functions it can perform. The human needs
 inputs and outputs to take advantage of those functions. The interface 
is the arrangement of inputs and outputs that enable people to apply the
 computer's functions to create outcomes they want. - <a href="http://feltpresence.com/articles/19-what-ui-really-is-and-how-ux-%20confuses-matters">Ryan Singer</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the context of our software, the user interface is the individual views that provide for goal completion.</p>
        <p>We evaluate interfaces on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Puts outcomes first</strong></li>
        <li>Provides users with affordances</li>
        <li>Congruent with surrounding platform</li>
        <li>Consistent across entire application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We put the users goals first. No one is using our software 
exclusively because of how beautiful it is. There's a reason they sought
 our solution out. Making that outcome easily attainable and desirable 
is our highest priority.</p>
        <p>We make software easy to comprehend. It's not enough to be 
functional, users must know capabilities exist and be able to anticipate
 how the software is going to react to their inputs. Our software should
 be as intuitive as possible.</p>
        <p>We remain consistent with platform guidelines. Interfaces 
look and feel best when in congruence with their context, rather than 
being strictly branded across all platforms. We prefer common patterns 
when designing.</p>
        <p>We retain consistency. Usable interfaces work as expected across the entire application.</p>
        <h2 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h2>
        <p>Interaction gives users the ability to change the canvas, to 
directly manipulate. Designing those interactions is what makes our 
software come to life. Interactions should provide affordance â€” <a href="http://medium.com/p/926eb80d64e3">animation, for examples</a>,
 can be used as a powerful metaphor for helping a user understand an 
interface. Interactions help guide a user from the beginning of a task 
through it's completion.</p>
        <p>Designers guide these interactions from prototype to 
implementation. For web applications we start in the browser. For iOS, 
we use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/graphics-and-animation.html">QuartzComposer</a>. For review, we use <a href="http://gifbrewery.com/">gifs</a> to demonstrate interactions.</p>
        <h2 id="visual-design">Visual Design</h2>
        <p>We refer to an application's visual design exclusively as its style. We use the <a href="https://upcase.com/design-for-developers-resources/principles">universal design principles</a> to communicate and bring order to those ideas in our applications.</p>
        <p>Those fundamentals include, among others:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Alignment (often achieved with grids)</li>
        <li>Emphasis (often achieved with size, position, color)</li>
        <li>Consistency (buttons, links, headers typically look alike)</li>
        <li>Whitespace (elegant, timeless, gives eye a rest)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Successful visual designs typically don't draw attention to 
themselves. The content will be front-and-center. The workflows through 
the site will be obvious. Resist the temptation to aim for a design that
 is "memorable" or a design that "pops."</p>
        <p>Successful designs are usable. Consider Google's visual design:</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/google-mail.jpg" alt="Gmail"><figcaption>Gmail</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Everything's on a grid. The "Search Mail" and "Compose Mail" 
buttons are emphasized over other calls to action with color. The unread
 messages are emphasized over other messages with a bold font weight.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/google-search.jpg" alt="Google Search"><figcaption>Google Search</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Everything's on a grid. There is lots of whitespace (especially with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock</a>). Search interface is consistent with Gmail. Search button is emphasized with color.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/google-video.jpg" alt="Google Video"><figcaption>Google Video</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Grids. Whitespace. Consistent search box, search filters, search results.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/google-places.jpg" alt="Google Places"><figcaption>Google Places</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Grids. Whitespace. Emphasis on searching and writing a review.</p>
        <p>We say "visual design" instead of "graphic design" because 
typically graphics aren't called for in our applications. Instead, we 
rely on these principles and excellent <a href="https://upcase.com/design-for-developers-resources/typography">typography</a>, using high-quality typefaces from <a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> and <a href="http://www.typography.com/">typography.com</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="user-interviews-usability-testing">User Interviews &amp; Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Running user interviews and usability tests early and often 
is critical to product success. We even test sketches to get a feel for 
flows and mental models. The earlier the stage, the more we're testing 
the problem/solution fit and gathering research on potential users. The 
later the stage, the more we're testing actual usability of the product.</p>
        <p>User interviews and usability tests are the most effective 
way to test a product viability and usability. By continually testing it
 verifies that the product and team are focused on solving people's real
 problems and creating a great user experience for the product. We've 
found that having a testing plan early is the best way to consistently 
run user interviews and usability tests during the project. A starting 
point for the project's interviews and testing should be biweekly. This 
sets the expectation that interviews and testing are needed and the team
 should discuss if that plan will work for their individual project. 
Testing should always accommodate the users and project needs.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We're testing the software, not you.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Usability is the measure of how easy it is for a user to reach an outcome.</p>
        <p>We think about usability testing similarly to test-driven 
development: writing falsifiable outcomes for users. Our outcomes are 
written in the form of a script that's written in the same way as a <a href="http://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/">jobs story</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>When I arrive at work I want to review the team's status updates so I can help any blocked teamates.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once the script is written, we find testers.</p>
        <p>The most representative candidates are going to be sourced 
from our existing userbase. Send out a tweet, add a banner to our site, 
or add a link to our newsletter. Even pre-launched projects have a 
mailing list to use.</p>
        <p>When we have trouble sourcing or aren't interested in 
existing users, craigslist can be effective to find candidates. Our 
office manager puts a posting on craigslist, schedules them to come into
 our office, and pays them $30 for their time after the test.</p>
        <p>We have a simple <a href="https://gist.github.com/croaky/1a1ff3902b4321984b0b">template for finding people on craigslist</a>.</p>
        <p>After the tester has arrived, we introduce ourselves and 
explain the process. There's no need to be strictly formal, we want them
 to be at ease. To have a relaxed user test, it's important to remind 
the user of a few things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>"We are looking for your honest feedback."</li>
        <li>"None of what you're about to see was made by me. There's no way you can hurt my feelings."</li>
        <li>"We're testing the software, not you. It's not user testing, it's usability testing."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we are filming them, we ask them to sign <a href="https://gist.github.com/croaky/bf97025689b019293f78">a simple consent form</a>.</p>
        <p>Once underway, we ask them to say out loud what they're 
thinking as they're using the software, which can feel unnatural but is 
important. While running the session, the only reasons to speak are to 
get them to talk out loud again, ask questions, and provide them with 
outcomes to achieve.</p>
        <p>We should avoid leading questions such as "Was this task 
difficult for you?" but should ask follow-up questions. For example, if 
someone says "That's awesome!", we shouldn't silently pat ourselves on 
the back. We should say "Why is it awesome for you?" We are seeking 
understanding.</p>
        <p>After the session, we look back at our notes to identify the 
top handful of problems and fix them before the next round of usability 
tests. If there's a problem revealed with the navigation, there's a 
temptation to totally re-do it. We try to resist that urge and come up 
with less drastic changes.</p>
        <h1 id="developing">Developing</h1>
        <p>The majority of our development practices were first detailed in Kent Beck's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Edition-ebook/dp/B000OZ0N5S/ref=tmm_kin_title_0">Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</a> and in Gerald Weinberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychology-Computer-Programming-Anniversary/dp/0932633420">The Psychology of Computer Programming</a>.
 We've tried its practices and found that using most of the practices 
most of the time improves the quality of our work and happiness of our 
team.</p>
        <h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
        <p>We always use source code control. It's like a time machine. 
We can work in parallel universes of our source code, experimenting 
without fear of losing work. Roll back if something goes wrong.</p>
        <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is an open source source code control system written by Linus Torvalds. It's fast and great for working in branches.</p>
        <p>We use <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> for hosting our git repositories.</p>
        <h2 id="style-guide">Style Guide</h2>
        <p>We write code in a consistent <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style">style</a> that emphasizes cleanliness and team communication.</p>
        <p>High level guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Be consistent.</li>
        <li>Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.</li>
        <li>Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.</li>
        <li>A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h2>
        <p>Code that is written by two people who sit next to each other at the same computer is <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair-programmed</a> code. That code is considered high quality and should result in cost savings due to less maintenance.</p>
        <p>In the long run, this style of development saves money 
because fewer bugs are written and therefore do not need to be fixed 
later.</p>
        <p>An indication that pairing is beneficial and should be done more often is the following example:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>When you are writing an important piece of code, don't you want another person to look it over before it goes into production?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>While we don't pair program 100% of the time, we recognize 
the difficulty in acting as a team when we work at a distance from each 
other. There is no better collaboration between designers, developers, 
or between designers and developers than at the keyboard.</p>
        <h2 id="test-driven-development">Test-Driven Development</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</a> is perhaps the most important Extreme Programming (XP) rule that we practice.</p>
        <p>Business benefits of TDD:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Deliver more value, faster</li>
        <li>Always ship working software</li>
        <li>Adapt to change quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Code benefits of TDD:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Readable specs and code</li>
        <li>Clean public interfaces</li>
        <li>Decoupled modules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Process benefits of TDD:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Regression safety net</li>
        <li>Fearless refactoring</li>
        <li>Team trust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At a high level, how to test is very simple:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Write test first.</li>
        <li>Red-Green-Refactor cycle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more specifics, we recommend our <a href="https://upcase.com/test-driven-rails">Test-Driven Rails</a>
 workshop, which we run about once a month. It goes into incredible 
detail about the TDD workflow specifically for Ruby on Rails developers.</p>
        <h2 id="acceptance-tests">Acceptance Tests</h2>
        <p>Acceptance tests are code created from jobs stories. <a href="https://gist.github.com/croaky/d8699363382d86c10c54">They look like this</a>.
 This code is run against the application. When executed for the first 
time, the test will fail. The developer writes application code until 
the test passes.</p>
        <p>When the test passes, the developer commits the code into version control with a message such as:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Guest creates pledge</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The code is then run on the <a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</a> server to make sure the acceptance test still passes in an environment that matches the production environment.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the code is pushed to the staging environment and 
the developer and customer representative smoke test it in the browser.</p>
        <p>When the acceptance test is green for the CI server and you 
and any other designers, developers, or clients are satisfied that the 
jobs story is complete on staging, the feature can be deployed to 
production at will. This can result in features being pushed to 
production very frequently, and therefore more value is being delivered 
to customers sooner.</p>
        <h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>
        <p>The third step of the "red, green, refactor" step is 
refactoring, the process of improving the design of existing code 
without altering its external behavior. It's a critical step in the 
process, but often overlooked. We're so passionate about refactoring, we
 wrote an entire book on it, <a href="https://upcase.com/ruby-science">Ruby Science</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="code-reviews">Code Reviews</h2>
        <p>Here's the flow. Read <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol">our git protocol</a> for the git commands.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Create a local feature branch based off master.</li>
        <li>When feature is complete and tests pass, stage the changes.</li>
        <li>When you've staged the changes, commit them.</li>
        <li>Write a <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message">good commit message</a>.</li>
        <li>Share your branch.</li>
        <li>Submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">GitHub pull request</a>.</li>
        <li>Ask for a code review in <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</li>
        <li>A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/code-review">Code Review</a> guidelines to avoid miscommunication.</li>
        <li>They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the GitHub web interface or in Slack.</li>
        <li>When satisfied, they comment on the pull request "Ready to merge."</li>
        <li>Rebase interactively. Squash commits like "Fix whitespace" 
into one or a small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages 
to reveal intent.</li>
        <li>View a list of new commits. View changed files. Merge branch into master.</li>
        <li>Delete your remote feature branch.</li>
        <li>Delete your local feature branch.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Test-Driven Development moves code failure earlier in the 
development process. It's better to have a failing test on your 
development machine than in production. It also allows you to have 
tighter feedback cycles.</p>
        <p>Code reviews that happen right before code goes into master offer similar benefits:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The whole team learns about new code as it is written.</li>
        <li>Mistakes are caught earlier.</li>
        <li>Coding standards are more likely to be established, discussed, and followed.</li>
        <li>Feedback from this style of code review is far more likely to be applied.</li>
        <li>No one forgets context ("Why did we write this?") since it's fresh in the author's mind.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
        <p>Martin Fowler has an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">extensive description</a> of Continuous Integration. The basics are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We have a test suite that each developer runs on their own machine.</li>
        <li>When they commit their code to a shared version control 
repository, the tests are run again, "integrated" with code from other 
developers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helps ensure there's nothing specific to the developer's
 machine making the tests pass. The code in version control needs to run
 cleanly in production later so before the code is allowed to be 
deployed to production, it is run on a CI server or service.</p>
        <p>When a build fails, we get alerts in Slack and via email. 
Click the alert and we see a backtrace that gives us a hint of how to 
"fix the build."</p>
        <p>When we write the fix and commit to version control again, 
we'll get a "passing build" alert in Slack and via email. Click the 
alert and we see the passing build.</p>
        <p>Green is good.</p>
        <p>A solid test suite is an absolute requirement for a web 
application in our opinion. However, one major problem with test suites 
is that they get slow as they get large.</p>
        <p>CI can ease the pain by distributing the test runs in 
parallel. We've had 45 minute test suites cut down to 2 minutes using 
this technique.</p>
        <p>We've used CruiseControl, Integrity, Hudson (now called 
Jenkins), and other CI libraries that we manage ourselves. This resulted
 in many hours of expensive attention.</p>
        <p>We use <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI Free</a> for open source projects. We use <a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/">Travis CI Pro</a> for private repositories because of its consistent UI, simple configuration and its close integration with GitHub.</p>
        <p>CI test runs are triggered by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks">GitHub post-receive hooks</a>. The hooks we have on most of our GitHub repos are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Travis for Continuous Integration</li>
        <li><a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> for code quality and security checks</li>
        <li><a href="https://houndci.com/">Hound</a> for style guide enforcement</li>
        <li>Slack for chat room notifications</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="production">Production</h1>
        <p>We live in a magical modern era where many problems have 
already been solved for us. We focus on the client's product as much as 
possible and outsource operations as much as possible to external 
services.</p>
        <p>This saves time and money. We can get started using those 
services in minutes. Our clients pay a service tens or hundreds of 
dollars per month instead of paying developers thousands or tens of 
thousands.</p>
        <p>We often create a Google spreadsheet listing the monthly 
cost, description, and credentials of each of our clients' external 
services. It includes line items like GitHub, Heroku, SendGrid, New 
Relic, and Airbrake.</p>
        <h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
        <p>We have found that a short checklist is valuable when setting up a new production environment or preparing for a launch:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Are we on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack">latest Heroku stack</a>?</li>
        <li>Are we using a concurrent web server? See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server">how to deploy with Puma</a>.</li>
        <li>Are long-running processes such as email delivery being run in background jobs? See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#production-tier-database">how to set up Delayed Job</a>.</li>
        <li>Are there redundant (at least two) web and background processes running?</li>
        <li>Are we using SSL? See "<a href="#ssl-certificates">SSL Certificates</a>" section below.</li>
        <li>Are API requests being made via a separate subdomain (<code>api.example.com</code>)? Even if the same app, this gives us architectural flexibility in the future.</li>
        <li>Is the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">latest Ruby</a> defined in the <code>Gemfile</code>? See <a href="http://bundler.io/v1.11/gemfile_ruby.html">how to set it up</a>.</li>
        <li>Is <a href="http://12factor.net/config">config stored in environment variables</a>?</li>
        <li>Are deploys done manually at a scheduled time when teammates are fresh and available if something goes wrong?</li>
        <li>Do deploys follow <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/rails#deploy">a well-documented script</a>?</li>
        <li>Are we sending logs to a remote logging service? See "<a href="#log-collection">Log Collection</a>" section below.</li>
        <li>Are we using a Heroku "Standard" database or higher? See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#production-tier-database">Heroku production databases</a>.</li>
        <li>Are we backing up our production database? See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups">Heroku PGBackups</a>.</li>
        <li>Are we monitoring performance and uptime? See "<a href="#performance-monitoring">Performance Monitoring</a>" section below. See <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>.</li>
        <li>Are we tracking errors? See "<a href="#error-tracking">Error Tracking</a>" section below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="domain-names">Domain Names</h2>
        <p>Use <a href="http://domai.nr/">Domainr</a> to see what's available.</p>
        <p>Use <a href="http://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a> to buy and 
maintain domain names. If a client already has a domain registered 
elsewhere, like GoDaddy, DNSimple provides a transfer service that makes
 it easy to switch.</p>
        <p>We like it for its simplicity. It also has templates we most often need:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Heroku</li>
        <li>Google Apps</li>
        <li>Tumblr</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Follow the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains">Custom Domains</a> tutorial to set up root and subdomains on Heroku.</p>
        <h2 id="ssl-certificates">SSL Certificates</h2>
        <p>Buy a <a href="https://dnsimple.com/ssl-certificate">wildcard certificate from DNSimple</a>. The wildcard (<code>*</code>) lets you use the same certificate on <code>www.</code>, <code>staging.</code>, <code>api.</code>, and any other future subdomains.</p>
        <p>Follow <a href="https://gist.github.com/croaky/e0beb6025d58eeb88db5">these steps</a> for adding a DNSimple SSL certificate to Heroku.</p>
        <p>SSL and DNS are tightly coupled. If we're doing any work with
 SSL, we need to make sure we have access to make DNS changes, like 
adding a CNAME record. If we're working with a client who has a 
department that handles DNS, schedule time during off-peak hours to pair
 program with the DNS person to make sure everything goes well. We can 
accidentally take down a site that is all SSL if this work isn't done 
methodically.</p>
        <h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. It's a 
platform built on Amazon's cloud infrastructure. It is simple to use 
when our app is just a toy and is built to scale up for high concurrency
 or high sustained load.</p>
        <p>Like Rails, Heroku uses conventions to make decisions for us 
that are unnecessary for us to make. Some things like web servers and 
app servers are solved problems. They act as our outsourced operations 
team. The amount of time we can focus on the product instead of solved 
problems is worth the premium over bare-bones Amazon Web Services.</p>
        <p>The cloud promises lower operating costs, especially at the 
beginning when capacity can be lower. Forget about sunk costs of 
expensive servers.</p>
        <p>The cloud and the services it enables will empower our 
clients' businesses to start and operate in a manner that has never been
 possible before without significant upfront investment.</p>
        <p>If we offer file uploads for features like user avatars, we upload them to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
        <p>We also serve our images, CSS, and JavaScript assets from a CDN such as <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="performance-monitoring">Performance Monitoring</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://www.newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> (Free-$100s/month) to monitor performance of production applications.</p>
        <p>Debugging performance might be the best part of a developer's
 job. There's a clear, numeric problem. When we fix it, that number 
improves. We can say things like "We made this 175% better."</p>
        <p>There's many established techniques for fixing performance problems. A number of them come "for free" with Rails + Heroku:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Amazon server clusters</li>
        <li>gzipping</li>
        <li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset pipeline</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#sql-caching">SQL query caching</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A number of them require developer thought:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Database indexing</li>
        <li>Eager loading</li>
        <li>HTTP caching</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Page caching is the heaviest handed technique we have, but if
 we can cache an entire page and push it into a CDN, that will be the 
fastest option.</p>
        <h2 id="log-collection">Log Collection</h2>
        <p>Most applications write useful debugging information to logs.
 On Heroku, these go to standard output by default and are eventually 
discarded.</p>
        <p>We typically use <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>
 to accept logs from Heroku and other sources. Once sent to Logentries, 
you can search previous logs and set up alerts for errors outside the 
Rails stack, such as out of memory errors.</p>
        <p>If you're adding Logentries to a client project, the best 
solution is to have the client set up their own Logentries account and 
add the relevant thoughtbot members. If the client doesn't want to set 
it up or there's too much red tape, you can create a new project on the 
thoughtbot Logentries account and then delete it once our engagement has
 ended.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a login for the thoughtbot Logentries account yet, ask somebody to invite you. <strong>Don't use the Heroku Logentries addon</strong>, as it will automatically create a number of alerts and send them to every admin on our Heroku organization.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to set up Logentries for a Heroku application, follow the <a href="https://logentries.com/doc/heroku/#syslog_drain">instructions for setting up a syslog drain</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="error-tracking">Error Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://airbrake.io/">Airbrake Bug Tracker</a> (Free-$25/month).</p>
        <h2 id="transactional-email">Transactional Email</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> (Free-$400/month) to have our application deliver email to users, known as <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2010/04/foundry-group-invests-in-sendgrid/">transactional email</a>.</p>
        <p>Examples of transactional email are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Confirmations</li>
        <li>Follow ups after the first 3 days of use</li>
        <li>Free trial is expiring</li>
        <li>Message another user in the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use SendGrid directly, not via the Heroku add-on, in order
 to avoid being lumped under the same IP group as others on Heroku (who 
might be misbehaving).</p>
        <h2 id="payment-processing">Payment Processing</h2>
        <p>For collecting payments from users via credit or debit card, we use <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. It is a payment gateway and merchant account. We also use it for recurring billing.</p>
        <p>Charges for Stripe will vary depending on usage. Successful 
charges are 2.9% + 30 cents. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or 
card storage fees.</p>
        <p>For sending money to users' bank accounts via ACH, we use <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a>.</p>
        <h1 id="measuring">Measuring</h1>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"If you can not measure it, you can not improve it." -- Lord Kelvin</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The difficult part of measuring is deciding what to track.</p>
        <p>Dave McClure's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-nov-2012">AARRR framework</a> provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.</p>
        <h2 id="aarrr">AARRR</h2>
        <p>The AARR framework is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Acquisition</li>
        <li>Activation</li>
        <li>Retention</li>
        <li>Revenue</li>
        <li>Referral</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For an early stage product, we work to improve them in this order:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Activation: visitor finds the product desirable enough to try, is able to use it and get to <a href="http://www.growhack.com/2012/12/04/discovering-your-aha-moment/">aha moment</a> in shortest time possible</li>
        <li>Retention: user regularly uses product, it is doing the job they hired it for, customer is happy</li>
        <li>Revenue: user pays for product</li>
        <li>Acquisition: we know where our users come from, are able to 
try new channels, run tests, and kill or double-down on different 
channels</li>
        <li>Referral: users refer other users, the ideal acquisition channel</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="instrumentation">Instrumentation</h2>
        <p>In order to analyze metrics later, we need to instrument our 
app to log the right metrics. The primary type of instrumentation we 
care about is called "event tracking."</p>
        <p>Use <a href="https://segment.io/">Segment.io</a> to capture events whenever possible. It is basically <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/adapter">the adapter pattern</a> for analytics services.</p>
        <p>Segment.io lets us drop one JS library into our web apps, or 
one Ruby library into our server-side framework, or one iOS SDK into our
 mobile apps. Then, we can toggle on and off different services such as 
Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Intercom, Olark, Localytics, and others.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="playbook_files/segment-io.jpg" alt="Segment.io"><figcaption>Segment.io</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Segment.io's API endpoint is hosted on Amazon CloudFront. So,
 it has extremely good uptime and you can have Segment pipe the 
CloudFront logs for your apps to your own S3 bucket, giving you access 
to your raw logs.</p>
        <p>When Segment.io does not support a backend service, we can either use the service directly or contribute to the appropriate <a href="https://segment.io/libraries/analytics.js">Segment.io open source libraries</a>.</p>
        <p>The hardest part of event tracking is choosing the <a href="http://qr.ae/GBPdx">granularity of the events</a>. It's costly to reconstruct historical measurements and missed knowledge can kill an early-stage product. So:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>track events as soon as they exist in the product</li>
        <li>err on the side of more data than less</li>
        <li>include as much state as possible per event</li>
        <li>own the data from the start</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some typical events we'll want to track:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>open app (mobile)</li>
        <li>background app (mobile)</li>
        <li>pageviews (web)</li>
        <li>create account</li>
        <li>make purchase</li>
        <li>add content</li>
        <li>make connection/friend</li>
        <li>upgrade subscription</li>
        <li>refer friend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use properties on events liberally. Typically include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>session ID</li>
        <li>all user properties</li>
        <li>environment: operating system, app version, device hardware details,</li>
        <li>current battery, wifi, cellular status</li>
        <li>number of seconds into the session</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="http://mcfunley.com/whom-the-gods-would-destroy-they-first-give-real-time-analytics">Business analytics do not need to be realtime</a>
 and tracking these data should not slow down the user experience. So, 
we background these tasks whenever possible using whatever backgrounding
 system makes sense for our platform. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> and <a href="http://www.iron.io/worker">IronWorker</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="subscription-metrics">Subscription Metrics</h2>
        <p>We work on a lot of products that have a monthly or yearly 
subscription business model. There are some classic metrics we know we 
want to track for these products, such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</li>
        <li>Active subscriptions</li>
        <li>Lifetime Value (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value">LTV</a>)</li>
        <li>Churn per-plan, monthly and annually</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since we use Stripe for payments, we've found <a href="https://www.baremetrics.io/">Baremetrics</a> is the fastest and easiest way to track these metrics.</p>
        <p>If our clients want to raise money from investors, the following numbers are generally considered investment-ready:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">LTV is 3x-5x greater than Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">10-30% month-over-month growth in MRR</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://sixteenventures.com/saas-churn-rate">5-7% annual churn</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Churn is particularly critical when fundraising. <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/why-churn-is-critical-in-saas/">Small changes in churn can drastically improve valuation</a>.</p>
        <p>Calculating CAC is a manual <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/thoughtbot.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnkUc5wE2xc6dGhHSUpnTy03MDlJd29xc3BzbWg2Unc">spreadsheet exercise</a>.
 It requires adding employee overhead costs and direct marketing costs 
together, then dividing by the number of new customers for that month.</p>
        <p>For <a href="https://upcase.com/">Upcase</a>, we can rely on our bookkeeper, <a href="http://www.supportingstrategies.com/">Supporting Strategies</a>
 to provide us with those numbers, and make adjustments for which 
vendors such as Google (AdWords), Twitter, or AdRoll fall under the 
direct marketing accounting class.</p>
        <h2 id="ab-testing">A/B Testing</h2>
        <p>Someone can tell us in a usability test when they're confused
 by a page or when they're frustrated by upsells during the checkout 
process. They probably can't tell us whether one set of copy or another 
is more likely to make them feel an affinity with our landing page, pull
 out their wallet, and plunk down cash.</p>
        <p>So, we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B test</a> landing pages and payment flows.</p>
        <p>We don't A/B test price. Users talk to each other and it can 
make customer support difficult. We test the price off-line via customer
 interviews instead.</p>
        <h2 id="feature-flags">Feature Flags</h2>
        <p>Software is soft. It's always changing. Hopefully, we're always learning from our changes.</p>
        <p>A cool way to manage changes is via feature flags. Using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/FetLife/rollout">Rollout</a>,
 we can "flag" certain features as only ready for parts of our user 
base; i.e. just the development team, or just the founder's friends, or 
10% of all users, etc.</p>
        <p>That way, we can see how users respond to the feature without
 rolling it out to everyone. We can pair this technique with A/B testing
 to compare how users respond to different features.</p>
        <h1 id="sales">Sales</h1>
        <p>We're designers and developers. We want to design and develop
 software. Before we can do that, we need clients to hire us. The 
following section details how our sales process works and answers 
commonly asked questions by potential clients.</p>
        <p>The overall process is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Someone contacts us.</li>
        <li>We have them fill out <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/contact">our new project form</a>.</li>
        <li>We have a phone call or have them come into the office.</li>
        <li>Qualify/disqualify: are we a good fit for the client?</li>
        <li>Qualify/disqualify: is the client a good fit for us?</li>
        <li>Understand the client's vision.</li>
        <li>Agree to the outcomes we're trying to achieve.</li>
        <li>Estimate iterations.</li>
        <li>Schedule people for iterations.</li>
        <li>Sign the contract.</li>
        <li>Pay us for the first iteration.</li>
        <li>We begin work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="leads">Leads</h2>
        <p>Our leads often come from <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whos-the-best-web-development-firm-in-Boston">referrals from clients</a> and Google searches.</p>
        <p>We track each lead on a <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> card in the "Contacted" list on our "Sales" board:</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/sales-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/sales-trello_small.jpg" alt="Sales Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 316px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Sales Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We manually create cards for personal introductions. <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/#new-project">Our new project form</a> automatically creates cards for each submission. <a href="http://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> automatically creates cards for each voicemail we receive into our main phone line.</p>
        <p>The Managing Director will get assigned to the card for the 
incoming lead but anyone can take responsibility for that lead. The 
person responsible qualifies or disqualifies the lead, often with a 
quick intro email or phone call with the potential client. Before they 
do that they should add themselves as a member on the Trello card.</p>
        <p>We prefer to pair on sales calls, having at least one 
designer and one developer on the call. This enables us to get multiple 
opinions on how good or bad of a fit the client and project might be for
 us, it gives us the ability to answer both design and development 
questions to the best of our ability, and it allows us to train and 
improve our process during sales calls.</p>
        <h2 id="understanding-product-vision">Understanding Product Vision</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to begin thinking about the client's product and 
working as a team to plan it even before we officially start working 
together. Some example questions to ask:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What's unique about this product?</li>
        <li>What big benefit does the product provide?</li>
        <li>What pain does the product alleviate?</li>
        <li>Who currently buys this product?</li>
        <li>Who do you want to buy this product?</li>
        <li>What do customers love about your product?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We distribute the sales process throughout the team. 
Potential clients should be able to talk to the people they'll work 
with. We should be able to handle spikes in incoming leads that make it 
unreasonable for a managing director to respond in a timely fashion.</p>
        <p>We use an internal app to manage our schedule and availability. We don't track time, but we do plan in week increments.</p>
        <h2 id="ndas">NDAs</h2>
        <p>If the client asks us to sign an NDA, we respond with:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Are you willing to chat without signing an NDA?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We've worked with hundreds of clients. We talk to hundreds of
 potential clients each year. It's inevitable that we hear similar 
ideas.</p>
        <p>If the NDA is important to the client, ask them to tell us 
enough about the business to evaluate whether there's a conflict with 
our existing or past clients. If we determine there's no conflict, the 
project is a good fit, and the NDA is mutual, we sign it. If their NDA 
is not mutual, we use <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/nda">our NDA</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
        <p>We offer some combination of designers, Ruby developers, and 
iOS developers. An advisor assists the team for a few hours a week. 
Everyone is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T-shaped</a>, deep in some area of expertise with the ability to collaborate across disciplines.</p>
        <p>We are people, not "resources", and avoid calling each other 
such because we understand we are working with each other as people.</p>
        <p>The designer is responsible for designing interactions between users and the product. They write user interface code.</p>
        <p>The developers make it work. They write the code that makes 
the app "smart." They aim to make the product error-free. They monitor 
performance because speed is a feature of every application.</p>
        <p>Developers keep it running. They make architectural decisions and interact with modern-day hosting companies like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, whose employees double as our outsourced operations team.</p>
        <p>The developers also implement. They write and maintain HTML, 
CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, SQL, and lots of other code. They set and meet 
development standards, keep the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html">Continuous Integration</a> build passing, and review each others' code.</p>
        <p>The advisor adds an impartial perspective. They run weekly 
meetings so that there is consistency in week-to-week communication. 
They keep an eye on the high-level goals of the project, which should be
 easier for them because they are not in the weeds of the project 
day-to-day. They express enthusiasm when the team is in a groove and 
help problem-solve when things get off track.</p>
        <p>When appropriate, they should work with the client to either reduce or increase team size to correctly serve the project.</p>
        <p>The advisor is not a project manager. The rest of the team 
does not report to them. The advisor is also not a technical or design 
lead. Advisors need not be Managing Directors or CXOs, but typically are
 due to flexibility in schedule. Anyone at thoughtbot should be able to 
advise a project. If the primary salesperson is not also the advisor, 
there should be a smooth hand-off from one to the other.</p>
        <p>While each person plays a role, a team needs to be a team.</p>
        <p>Everyone takes responsibility every day for delivering high 
quality work, for staying true to the vision for the product, for 
communicating their schedule and intentions, for making hard decisions, 
for delegating to others when they don't have the time or skill to 
accomplish a task, for keeping team morale up, and for being consistent.</p>
        <h2 id="no-fixed-bids">No Fixed Bids</h2>
        <p>Some consulting relationships start with a requirements 
document or RFP ("Request For Proposal"). The requirements are often 
extremely detailed.</p>
        <p>The probability of this document containing the optimum 
feature set is extremely low. The right features are better learned 
through user interviews, prototyping, releasing actual software, and 
getting feedback from real users.</p>
        <p>Based on that document, clients expect consultants in the 
industry to submit an exact timeframe and bid. This contract style sets 
the client and consultant working against each other right from day one.
 Instead of focusing on designing the product experience or evaluating 
what assumptions were wrong, they spend time negotiating about what was 
meant in a document written a long time ago or focusing on arbitrary 
deadlines. But it's worse than negotiating; it's retroactively 
discussing something that no one remembers the same way.</p>
        <p>As you might have guessed, we don't do fixed-bid, fixed-feature-set proposals.</p>
        <h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>
        <p>We do <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-today/a61ec864c898">need to know clients' budgets</a>.
 This is often uncomfortable for them but their budget helps determines 
what scope is possible. It saves time. If they don't know their budget, 
we discuss different options.</p>
        <p>We talk about breaking product rollout into stages and try to improve the product's chances of success at each stage by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Focusing on a small subset of features.</li>
        <li>Designing a valuable user experience.</li>
        <li>Developing a meaningful relationship with users.</li>
        <li>Budgeting for marketing tactics to tell users about the product.</li>
        <li>Designing interactions into the product for users to bring other users to the product.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="rate">Rate</h2>
        <p>We price projects at a per person, per week rate. We consult 4
 days per week. We use the same rate for designers and developers. The 
work required for each week dictates which skills are needed. The number
 of people needed determines the cost and how much gets done.</p>
        <p>During the process of explaining our billing, we sometimes 
tell potential clients "time and materials" is the same as hiring an 
employee for their annual time except there's less risk to them because:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Our team is experienced. We've interviewed more than a 
thousand candidates in order to find the talented group of people we 
work with today.</li>
        <li>We've worked together on projects before. We have "a way" of doing things.</li>
        <li>Short projects require less money.</li>
        <li>Our time is predictable (4 days/week) and consistent.</li>
        <li>We can quickly rotate in a new team member if someone gets sick, leaves the company, or is ready to rotate to a new project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We don't provide itemized invoices to clients showing 
individual pieces of work that were done. Clients always know what is 
happening via access to the project management system (Trello), chat 
room (Slack), version control system (GitHub), and ongoing communication
 with our teammates.</p>
        <h2 id="typical-projects">Typical Projects</h2>
        <p>Examples of typical projects for us are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint">"Product design sprint"</a>, 2 people, 1 week</li>
        <li>"Zero to Version 1", 2 people, 4 weeks</li>
        <li>"Fill a gap until an internal team is hired", 2 people, 3 months</li>
        <li>"Staff augmentation with existing internal team", 3 people, 6 months</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/maintenance">"Maintenance team"</a>, retainer per month</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On many occasions we've done projects for clients who have a 
budget enough for a "Version 1" product. They followed that up with a 
round of beta invites, time spent learning in the market, a round of 
funding, or a few months of revenue. They come back for another round of
 design and development with a more informed sense of where the product 
needs to go.</p>
        <p>The feature set of a product is not necessarily indicative of
 the length of time required to develop it. Sometimes to get to a very 
simple product, we have to iterate on it many times. We love working 
with clients who understand that a great product takes as long as it 
takes.</p>
        <p>In return, we understand that we can never abuse a client's 
trust in us. We should be maximizing our productivity in order to 
provide them the most value for our time. Things like our "Research" 
Trello board, "Code" internal chat room, and shared <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> ensure we have a highest common denominator set of tools and techniques ready when the situation arises again.</p>
        <h2 id="contract">Contract</h2>
        <p>We store contracts in Dropbox and have a series of folders for pending, current, past, and lost clients.</p>
        <p>The consulting proposal and contract contains:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A one-page summary of the expected work.</li>
        <li>Our weekly rate.</li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_15">Net 15</a> payment terms.</li>
        <li>Payment for the first two weeks is required to start working.</li>
        <li>After the first two weeks, invoices will go out once a week on Saturday mornings for the prior week's work.</li>
        <li>Agreement that the client owns the week's source code once they've paid their weekly invoice.</li>
        <li>Agreement that both parties won't use materials which break someone else's copyright.</li>
        <li>Agreement that both parties won't publish things to the web hosting provider which are abusive or unethical.</li>
        <li>Agreement that the contract is mutually "at-will" and either side can decide to stop work at the end of a week.</li>
        <li>A page for signatures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="invoices">Invoices</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to invoice our clients at the end of each week.</p>
        <p>It sends recurring invoices so we don't forget to bill people
 at the end of the week. It automatically sends late payment 
notifications, limiting awkward conversations about the bill.</p>
        <p>Clients can pay their invoice via check or wire transfer.</p>
        <p>We track who at thoughtbot should receive a commission in the
 project notes field of the project's profile in Harvest. We often split
 the 5% commission among two or three people who were involved in the 
sales process.</p>
        <h1 id="hiring">Hiring</h1>
        <p>We are not the permanent team solution for our clients. They often want to know:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>How do I find a technical co-founder?</li>
        <li>How can I learn to "do it myself"?</li>
        <li>How do I hire designers and developers?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We tell them:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>To find a technical co-founder, network in person at user 
groups and online at LinkedIn and AngelList. Is what you really need a <a href="http://www.designstaff.org/articles/does-your-startup-need-a-design-co-founder-2012-01-12.html">designer founder</a>?</li>
        <li>To learn to do what we do, sit next to us in our office for weeks at a time, pair programming and sketching together.</li>
        <li>To hire someone, follow the same process we use, detailed below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h2>
        <p>We've met our future teammates via:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
        <li>User groups</li>
        <li><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.authenticjobs.com/">Authentic Jobs</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We met Josh because he submitted excellent patches to <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance">Clearance</a>.
 He was in Michigan at the time. Due in part to their open source work, 
we've hired great people as far away as India and Thailand. We moved 
them to the cities where we have offices.</p>
        <p>Many of us are regulars at Ruby, JavaScript, Vim, and Redis user groups. We met Ben, Joel, and Mason at the Boston Ruby Group.</p>
        <p>A nice thing about those meetings are that they happen 
naturally. We're not trolling GitHub looking for people or fishing for 
talent at user groups and conferences. We're there, anyway. If we never 
hired again, we'd still be writing and using open source. We'd be 
members of mailing lists and going to events.</p>
        <p>We know what we'll get when we hire in the above ways. We 
know their personality and energy level from the user group. We know 
their coding style from their open source work. We know they'll take 
initiative because they voluntarily contributed to the community.</p>
        <p>We met Jessie and Laila via Dev Bootcamp. They went through <a href="http://apprentice.io/">apprentice.io</a>, as did Adarsh, Draper, Edwin, Diana, Melissa, JoÃ«l, Lisa, Lydia, Rich, Christian, and Tony.</p>
        <p>We've also had great luck finding designers on Authentic Jobs and iOS developers on Stack Overflow Careers.</p>
        <h2 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h2>
        <p>We track each candidate's progress through the interview process on a <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> card on our "Hiring" board:</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/hiring-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/hiring-trello_small.jpg" alt="Hiring Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 315px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Hiring Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We manually create cards for personal introductions. Our new teammate form automatically creates cards for each submission.</p>
        <p>Our CEO, Chad, leads the hiring process. He ensures that 
everyone gets a response and he speaks with everyone before they are 
hired.</p>
        <p>Anyone can do an initial review of the candidate's 
application. In particular, they review the candidate's code sample or 
portfolio. If necessary, they may ask someone else (like a designer or 
iOS developer) for another pair of eyes on the code or portfolio.</p>
        <p>We either send them a rejection or an email based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/croaky/3e12ff226d6b04451fe8">this template</a>, moving the Trello card to "Non-Technical Interview".</p>
        <p>Chad will pull the managing director, designers, or 
developers into subsequent discussions, putting their faces on the 
Trello cards to ensure we always know who is responsible.</p>
        <p>We have standard questions for iOS developers, Rails 
developers, and designers for the technical interview. We don't use 
puzzles or code challenges. Instead, we prefer reviewing actual work the
 candidate has done, and talking to them about design process, 
architecting systems, and writing code; the same thing we do for work 
every day.</p>
        <p>The final step for candidates is to visit us for a day. We 
pay for their flights and three nights of hotels (rest up Thursday 
night, work with us on Friday, enjoy Friday night, explore the city 
Saturday, fly home Sunday).</p>
        <p>On that day, developers <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair program</a> with one of our developers in the morning and another in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Designers pair in the morning and work on a small product 
design project throughout the day and then present at 4pm. It primarily 
involves sketching and working with one or two thoughtbot designers.</p>
        <p>We do the interviews this way because there's no substitute 
for seeing someone actually do the work and interacting with the team. 
We also want candidates to experience what the company is like for 
themselves.</p>
        <p>Aside from technical skill, during the entire interview process, we look for <a href="http://www.kipp.org/our-approach/strengths-and-behaviors">character strengths</a>
 like enthusiasm (invigorates others), focus (pays attention, resists 
distractions, remembers directions), composure (remains calm when 
critiqued, doesn't interrupt), gratitude (shows appreciation), curiosity
 (eager to explore, asks questions to understand, actively listens), 
optimism (gets over frustrations quickly), grit (finishes what he or she
 starts, doesn't get blocked), emotional intelligence (demonstrates 
respect for others' feelings, knows when and how to include others), 
humor (likes to laugh, makes others smile), and appreciation of beauty 
(notices and appreciates beauty and excellence).</p>
        <p>To be hired, the candidate must get a unanimous "yes" from the existing teammates with whom they interacted.</p>
        <h2 id="offer-and-onboarding">Offer and Onboarding</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://rightsignature.com/">RightSignature</a> ($14-$49/month) to send the offer and get them signed without the "print and scan" process on either end.</p>
        <p>Offers are reviewed and approved by at least one member of 
the C-level executive team before being sent. C-level executives and 
Managing Directors can execute offers on behalf of thoughtbot.</p>
        <p>When the offer is accepted, we run a custom onboarding script
 which we wrote. It creates the teammate's email address, gives them 
access to systems like GitHub and Slack, sends them their Employment 
Agreement, notifies Accounting, sends a welcome email to the teammate, 
and creates a todo list for the hiring manager for any remaining manual 
items that we haven't been able to automate.</p>
        <p>We assign a pair to new team members who acts as a guide on 
their first day. The pair helps them set up their machine, purchase any 
required software, and walk them through one turn of the development 
cycle by getting their profile added to our website. The pair also makes
 them feel comfortable, answers questions they may have, or points them 
to the person who can answer their questions.</p>
        <h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>
        <p>We are entirely bootstrapped, with no outside investors, and no debt. We are paid for consulting only four days each week.</p>
        <p>Sustainability of the company is very important to us. We 
want to bring great people on at reasonable salaries and reward them as 
aggressively as possible for actual performance.</p>
        <p>We may never be able to compete dollar for dollar with other 
tech companies but we can compete on being a great place to work, with 
lots of opportunities to learn, and the freedom to define and execute on
 our own projects.</p>
        <p>In addition to salary, everyone receives commission on any 
new work they help bring to the company, and quarterly profit sharing 
bonuses.</p>
        <p>Salary increases are the natural result of improvement, and 
occur company-wide on a yearly basis. Our manager may increase our 
salary in a way that is compatible with the company's finances and 
individually appropriate to us based on things we've done, such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>creating great software</li>
        <li>making users, teammates, and clients happy</li>
        <li>improving ourselves by learning something new</li>
        <li>improving thoughtbot by bringing in sales, mentoring a teammate, contributing to an internal tool or research</li>
        <li>improving our community by writing blog posts, contributing to open source, or attending conferences</li>
        <li>doing the things we didn't think to put on this list</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our salary increase may also include adjustments based on market conditions and cost of living increases.</p>
        <p>It's important that our manager explains why a raise is being
 given and what, if anything, could be done to receive a higher raise 
next time. We don't get raises for "just showing up."</p>
        <h2 id="quarterly-reviews">Quarterly Reviews</h2>
        <p>In order to continually improve ourselves and the company, 
all year round on every project we're on, we receive regular feedback 
from clients, managers, and teammates. We additionally have formal 
quarterly reviews.</p>
        <p>During onboarding, a "Quarterly Review" calendar event is 
created, set to recur once every 3 months, starting from the hire date.</p>
        <p>Ahead of the quarterly review, our manager collects anonymous
 feedback from everyone we've worked with in the quarter, and everyone 
in our office. The team feedback is shared with us before the review.</p>
        <p>The agenda for quarterly reviews is roughly:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Review the feedback from team members</li>
        <li>Our performance on recent consulting projects</li>
        <li>Our investment time contributions</li>
        <li>Our satisfaction with our work, projects, and the company</li>
        <li>Our questions about thoughtbot and our strategy</li>
        <li>Our areas of focus for the next quarter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results of the quarterly review are recorded and influence future compensation increases.</p>
        <h1 id="operations">Operations</h1>
        <p>Running a software-based business requires more than 
beautiful code or a popular product. Managing cash flow and taxes can 
feel unimportant or difficult but getting them right is as vital to our 
success as product design.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, many services exist which make things like bookkeeping, receipts, signatures, and invoicing much easier.</p>
        <p>Some principles have helped us streamline our operations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Outsource things which are super important but we are not excellent at.</li>
        <li>Spend time selecting a vendor and occasionally spend time reevaluating other vendors.</li>
        <li>Automate repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li>Give everyone "admin" access to as much as possible to avoid bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>Try to avoid building internal tools. It requires time and 
money to build and makes us reliant on ourselves when things don't work.</li>
        <li>Our problems are not unique. We will try manual processes 
first. When we do build something, it is usually after using other 
things for years.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>
        <p>Every full-time employee gets an American Express corporate 
card for business expenses. We've hired trustworthy people. Use your 
best judgement on how much to spend and what is a business expense. It 
saves time and treats people like adults.</p>
        <p>We buy things. The IRS appreciates it when we track those purchases. So do we, in order to know whether we're profitable.</p>
        <p>In the US, we use <a href="https://usetallie.com/sso">Tallie</a> to send all receipts (meals, travel, books, computers) to our accountant. In Stockholm, we use <a href="http://www.shoeboxed.com/">Shoeboxed</a>. - Instructions on <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/handbook/blob/master/purchasing/expenses-us.md">How to Use Tallie</a>. - There are also handy <a href="http://shoeboxed.com/iphone">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://shoeboxed.com/android">Android</a> Shoeboxed apps which take photos of receipts and send them on their way.</p>
        <h2 id="email">Email</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://mail.thoughtbot.com/">Gmail</a> for our email.</p>
        <h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://calendar.thoughtbot.com/">Google Calendar</a> for our calendars.</p>
        <h2 id="documents">Documents</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="http://docs.thoughtbot.com/">Google Docs</a> for our editable documents.</p>
        <p>We prefer Google Docs because they are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Easily sharable by URL. Everyone has a browser, not everyone has MS-Office or OpenOffice installed.</li>
        <li>Always up to date with the latest edits.</li>
        <li>Enable real-time collaboration, like group meeting notes.</li>
        <li>Autosaved to the cloud, so no worrying about backup.</li>
        <li>Are as easy to find as Googling something.</li>
        <li>Without document type versioning (e.g. xls vs. xlsx).</li>
        <li>Cheap.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tools are not well-suited for large documents or complicated spreadsheets, which is great.</p>
        <p>We write code and are biased toward minimal documentation and upfront specs so we shouldn't be writing long documents.</p>
        <p>For cases where we are writing large spreadsheets, we find 
it's faster to snap together a small app to do the job. This is a good 
time to ask if such complicated analysis is really necessary.</p>
        <p>When documents are mostly similar with slight variations (like contracts), we create templates using <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a> and export to PDF for external use.</p>
        <h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
        <p>We over-communicate with clients in-person and online to 
avoid having scheduled meetings. Every problem arises from poor 
communication.</p>
        <p>When we need to meet for a discussion, we aim for 30 minutes spent in-person.</p>
        <p>When working remotely, <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a>
 are indispensable as the "next best thing". They are easy to set up, 
sharable by URL, and let us get a look at whoever we're talking to.</p>
        <p>Screen-sharing is also very easy, when necessary. We have 
used Hangouts for client meetings, candidate interviews, and company 
meetings.</p>
        <p>We use conference lines that are part of our VoIP system, provided by <a href="http://www.onsip.com/">OnSip</a>, for voice conferencing.</p>
        <h2 id="accounting">Accounting</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.supportingstrategies.com/">Supporting Strategies</a>
 provides us with an outsourced bookkeeper, controller, and tax 
accountant/CPA. They provide us with a hosted QuickBooks install that we
 can access via Remote Desktop.</p>
        <p>We use <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com/">Earth Class Mail</a>
 to receive all paper mail for our offices. This service automatically 
opens and scans all paper mail and sends it as a PDF email attachment, 
which we file in Dropbox. Earth Class Mail also automatically detects 
checks and deposits them into our bank account.</p>
        <p>We interact with them mostly through email. It's very efficient and we pay for what we use, which is great for scaling.</p>
        <p>Our accountants review Harvest for new invoices and new 
payments on a daily basis and input them into QuickBooks. If any checks 
or wire transfers have come in, they are entered into Harvest and 
QuickBooks. Harvest sends payment received email notifications to both 
clients and the management team.</p>
        <p>All our receipts go to them automatically.</p>
        <p>Our CPA is excellent and provides these services for us:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Making sure payroll happens regularly and correctly.</li>
        <li>Gathering our accounts payable and making sure we pay partners promptly.</li>
        <li>Preparing monthly P&amp;L statements, broken down by services and products.</li>
        <li>Preparing our taxes.</li>
        <li>Making sure cash flow, checking account, savings account are in order.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Sweden we are assisted by <a href="http://www.radiusworldwide.com/">Radius</a> for company, accounting, tax, and human resources.</p>
        <h2 id="legal">Legal</h2>
        <p>Our law firm is <a href="http://www.gesmer.com/home.php">Gesmer Updegrove LLP</a>.
 They are able to provide us with legal support for most everything we 
need, which is most commonly client, real estate, and company/stock 
matters. We also engage <a href="http://www.rcosta.com/">Costa &amp; Riccio LLP</a> for US immigration matters.</p>
        <p>In Sweden we are assisted by <a href="http://www.newcomers.se/">Newcomers</a> for immigration and relocation matters.</p>
        <h1 id="sharing">Sharing</h1>
        <p>We've learned a ton from blog posts, tweets, and newsletters 
from others in the community. We should be giving back when we have 
something to share.</p>
        <h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
        <p>Our blog is called <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/">GIANT ROBOTS SMASHING INTO OTHER GIANT ROBOTS</a>.</p>
        <p>When you want to write a post, write its headline as a Trello
 card in the "Next Up" list of the Editorial Calendar board. Assign the 
Trello card to yourself ("put your face on it").</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/editorial-calendar-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/editorial-calendar-trello_small.jpg" alt="Editorial Calendar Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 403px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Editorial Calendar Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Spend time writing and re-writing <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">a great headline</a>. It helps you narrow your focus, figure out the purpose of the post, and grab people's attention in the first place.</p>
        <p>When you begin writing, move the Trello card to the "Drafts" list.</p>
        <p>Write the post in Markdown in the our blog's GitHub repo. Add tags to the post. Tags help our readers find related blog posts.</p>
        <p>When you're ready for feedback from the team, move the card 
to "In Review" list and share the Trello card's URL with the team in 
Slack. Make changes based on their feedback and your judgement.</p>
        <p>When the post is ready to publish, give it a published date, merge, and deploy.</p>
        <p>Our RSS feed, Zapier, Buffer accounts are set up to 
automatically work together to link to the post from Twitter, Facebook, 
Google+, and LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>Link to the post from Hacker News, Reddit, Delicious, Pinboard, or other appropriate sites.</p>
        <p>Move the Trello card to "Live."</p>
        <h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
        <p>You can tweet from our <a href="http://twitter.com/thoughtbot">thoughtbot</a> Twitter account at any time. If the tweet is not time-sensitive, add the tweet to our queue of tweets using Buffer.</p>
        <p>Be conversational, casual, and real on the Twitter account. 
Talk the same way as you would in person amongst ourselves. Be 
good-humored. Puns are encouraged. Keep the quality high. Aim for every 
tweet to be a hit. Avoid spelling mistakes. Use punctuation if writing 
sentences. Respect the people who follow us. To reach the largest 
audience, don't begin a tweet with a Twitter username.</p>
        <p>Some tweet ideas include announcing meetups, open source 
releases, enthusiasm about a new tool or technique, tips on Git, Unix, 
and Vim, links to our blog posts, links to others' blog posts if they 
are excellent and not on the current Hacker News or Twitter cycle at the
 moment, and Funkmaster Flex.</p>
        <p>We have a verified Twitter account and are a <a href="http://ads.twitter.com/">Twitter Ads</a> customer. Use the <span class="citation" data-cites="thoughtbot">@thoughtbot</span>
 credentials in 1Password to see analytics such as number of retweets, 
favorites, replies, clicks, follows, unfollows, and how tweets compare 
in terms of engagement.</p>
        <p>Promoted Tweets campaigns are best for short term campaigns to drive traffic to a website. Target 10-25 similar, relevant <span class="citation" data-cites="usernames">@usernames</span> in each campaign. Create different campaigns for different themes of people so that we can track performance per theme.</p>
        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <p>Ongoing experiments are managed in our "Research" Trello board:</p>
        <figure>
        <a class="fluidbox" href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/images/research-trello.jpg" rel="lightbox"><div class="fluidbox-wrap"><img style="opacity: 1;" src="playbook_files/research-trello_small.jpg" alt="Research Trello board"><div style="width: 640px; height: 398px; top: 30px; left: 0px;" class="fluidbox-ghost"></div></div></a><figcaption>Research Trello board</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We rigorously research, discuss, and conclude experiments on 
new tools and techniques. Write up these experiments on the blog at your
 discretion.</p>
        <h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
        <p>We've created a number of <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot">open source libraries</a> to help us perform common tasks and give back to the community.</p>
        <p>Our open source libraries do better when there's one person 
that really steps up to maintain them. Each of our repositories has a 
leader that tries to keep the repository moving forward. The leader 
doesn't necessarily do the bulk of the actual work; responsibilities 
include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Understand the underlying code and goal of the library</li>
        <li>Review and merge pull requests</li>
        <li>Respond to and close issues</li>
        <li>Push new releases of gems when appropriate</li>
        <li>Encourage people to take on useful tasks for the library</li>
        <li>Blog, tweet, and otherwise advertise new releases and tips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current open source leaders are listed in Basecamp.</p>
        <p>Every thoughtbot developer, designer, and apprentice has commit access to our open source repositories. Some guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You may want to check with the project leader to see what 
would be most useful, or whether or not they're on board with your idea.</li>
        <li>Send pull requests rather than committing straight to master.</li>
        <li>Try helping out with existing pull requests or bug reports.</li>
        <li>Documentation patches are a great way to get familiar with a project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Got an idea for a new library? Found something useful in a client project that you think is reusable? Great! Some guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Extractions are more likely to be useful than Brave New 
World ideas, because you're extracting something that has already proven
 useful once.</li>
        <li>If you create a new library, you're expected to lead it, at 
least for the beginning of its life. Make sure you have time to maintain
 it.</li>
        <li>Try not to duplicate something that's already been done well. Look around to make sure your problem hasn't already been solved.</li>
        <li>Fixing bugs that affect client projects or introducing small
 features that would really help a client project is fine during client 
time. Most open source work should be conducted during investment time.</li>
        <li>Think about whether your idea makes more sense as a pull request to an existing project.</li>
        </ul>
